## Horiseon Busnisess Operations 
  The Horiseon webpage has a navigation bar that takes you to different sections on the page where each section has a image and a description. A header image, cards with text and a footer with a image at the bottom of the page.


## Changes 
  Most of the changes that I made to the page was in the HTML file. I added alt attributes to the images so that way they had a description of what they are. I did have to fix one of the navigation options so it could take you to the Search Engine Optimization section. I also made sure everything was structured correctly from logical to sequential order. I also added some comments so it looked more organized.
